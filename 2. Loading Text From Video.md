# Loading Text from Video

Here, we use the webcam to set the frame right so that our text is clearly and completely visible. After that, we press 's' to obtain the text output. This has many errors as the image quality is quite compromised.

## Code 

The code is commented to capture main functionalities of the program.
```python
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract
import cv2

pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = (r"C:\Users\Manan K. Garg\PycharmProjects\practice\venv\Lib\site-packages\tesseract.exe") # Opens tesseract-ocr application

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) # capture frames from webcam
while(cap.isOpened()):
    ret, frame1 = cap.read() # read current frame
    cv2.imshow("Frame",frame1)

    key = cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF # 1 sec delay before the next frame is captured.
    if key == ord("s"): # s key freezes the frame
        text = pytesseract.image_to_string(frame1) # frame converts to text
        print(text)
        cv2.imshow("Frame", frame1)
        cv2.waitKey(0)
        break

cv2.destroyAllWindows()
cap.release()

```
