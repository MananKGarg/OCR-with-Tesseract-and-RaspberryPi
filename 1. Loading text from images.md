Introduction

Thave chosen the title Nature, Nurture and Chance: The Lives of Frank and Charles
Fenner, because I think that the first three words encapsulate the three elements
that determine the lives of all humans. In one way, quite apart from the changes
in the world around us, my father and I have had very different careers, yet my
life, of which I know much more than I could hope to find out about his, clearly
demonstrates the great importance of all three.

My father, Charles Fenner, was born in 1884 and died in 1955, I was born in
1914, and this book was published in 2006; a period of 122 years, during which
the world has changed more than at any other time in human history. This book
covers the period from 1895, when Father first got a job, until the present. He
grew up in a poor family, in the country; I grew up in a middle class family, in
the city. Each of us had the same two great loves in our intellectual lives: a love
of science and a love of writing. The first 11 chapters (Part I) deal with my career,
the next six (Part Il) with my father's life, and the last chapter deals mainly with
my life but also contains reflections on the contrasting lives of father and son.
The detailed information is located in two large files in the Basser Library,
Australian Academy of Science, Canberra; File 178 for Charles Fennerâ€™s life and
File 143 for mine.

Chapter 1 describes my childhood as the second of five children and contains a
description of family life. Chapter 2 describes my life at the University of
Adelaide, where I initially enrolled in Science and transferred to Medicine in
my second year. I was introduced into research by involvement with the Board
for Anthropological Studies' expeditions into Central Australia and my research
on Aboriginal skulls in the South Australian Museum, which formed the basis
for the award of the degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1942.

Chapter 3 describes my career in the Australian Army in World War 11, an
experience that largely determined my subsequent career. Before enlisting, 1
obtained a Diploma of Tropical Medicine at the University of Sydney, which,
after 13 months in the Middle East, led to appointments as pathologist to a
1,200-bed hospital in north Queensland for nine months and then as a
malariologist in New Guinea. My future wife, Bobbie Roberts, was a transfusion
expert in the hospital; we married when we were both in Melbourne during a
short break I had from New Guinea. As a malariologist, my research interests
switched from physical anthropology to infectious diseases and led to my
acceptance as a research worker with Australia's leading virologist, Macfarlane
Burnet, on discharge in February 1946,

Chapter 4 describes my immediate post-war career at the Walter and Eliza Hall
Institute in Melbourne, where Burnet suggested that I should work on the
